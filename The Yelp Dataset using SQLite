Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = id: 10000
ii. Hours = business_id: 1562
iii. Category = business_id: 2643
iv. Attribute = business_id: 1115
v. Review = id: 10000 | business_id: 8090 | user_id: 9581
vi. Checkin = business_id: 493
vii. Photo = id: 10000 | business_id: 6493
viii. Tip = user_id: 537 | business_id: 3979
ix. User = id: 10000
x. Friend = user_id: 11
xi. Elite_years = user_id: 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer:NO

| Yuri   |         1339 |
+--------+--------------+


8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	As you can see on below tables, the highest number of fans only have 609 review counts and on the second table, the highest review count only have 253 fans. 
Thus, it necessarily mean that review counts correlate with the number of fans. On that, it needed to be look on some factors that may produces fans.
	
SELECT name, review_count, fans
FROM user
ORDER BY fans DESC LIMIT 5
+-----------+--------------+------+
| name      | review_count | fans |
+-----------+--------------+------+
| Amy       |          609 |  503 |

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
+-------+-----------+--------------------------------+----------+----------------------+
| stars | city      | name                           | category | hours                |
+-------+-----------+--------------------------------+----------+----------------------+
|   5.0 | Las Vegas | Desert Medical Equipment       | Shopping | Monday|8:00-17:00    |
|   4.5 | Las Vegas | Red Rock Canyon Visitor Center | Shopping | Saturday|8:00-16:30  |
|   3.5 | Las Vegas | Wooly Wonders                  | Shopping | Saturday|10:00-16:00 |
|   2.5 | Las Vegas | Walgreens                      | Shopping | Saturday|8:00-22:00  |
+-------+-----------+--------------------------------+----------+----------------------+

I chose to the city of Las Vegas with a category of Shopping. 
Yes, they have different business hours.
Wooly Wonders & Walgreens with 2-3 stars are open on Saturdays with 6 and 14 business hours respectively.
While Red Rock Canyon Visitor Centre almost have a whole day and yet the business with 5 stars are close on weekends.


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
+-------+-----------+--------------------------------+----------+----------------------+--------------+
| stars | city      | name                           | category | hours                | review_count |
+-------+-----------+--------------------------------+----------+----------------------+--------------+
|   5.0 | Las Vegas | Desert Medical Equipment       | Shopping | Monday|8:00-17:00    |            4 |
|   4.5 | Las Vegas | Red Rock Canyon Visitor Center | Shopping | Saturday|8:00-16:30  |           32 |
|   3.5 | Las Vegas | Wooly Wonders                  | Shopping | Saturday|10:00-16:00 |           11 |
|   2.5 | Las Vegas | Walgreens                      | Shopping | Saturday|8:00-22:00  |            6 |
+-------+-----------+--------------------------------+----------+----------------------+--------------+
Yes.
Group of business with 2-3 stars has a meagre count of reviews. 
While the second group which is 4.5 stars of Red Rock Canyon Visitor Center have the highest count and surprisingly Desert Medical Equipment which owns 5 stars has the least count of reviews.


         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
+-------+-----------+--------------------------------+------------------------------------+--------+
| stars | city      | name                           | address                            | review |
+-------+-----------+--------------------------------+------------------------------------+--------+
|   5.0 | Las Vegas | Desert Medical Equipment       | 3555 W Reno Ave, Ste F, 89118      |      4 |
|   4.5 | Las Vegas | Red Rock Canyon Visitor Center | 1000 Scenic Loop Dr, 89161         |     32 |
|   3.5 | Las Vegas | Wooly Wonders                  | 3421 E Tropicana Ave, Ste I, 89121 |     11 |
|   2.5 | Las Vegas | Walgreens                      | 3808 E Tropicana Ave, 89121        |      6 |
+-------+-----------+--------------------------------+------------------------------------+--------+
Although this selection of data has same city, there are a big spread review count. 
On that, the data is quite skewed and need to investigate more why businesses with postal code of 89121 has a lower stars than other group. 


SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT business.stars, business.city, business.name, business.address ||', '|| business.postal_code as address, category.category, business.review_count as review
FROM (business INNER JOIN category ON business.id = category.business_id) INNER JOIN hours ON hours.business_id = business.id
WHERE business.city = 'Las Vegas' AND category.category = 'Shopping'
GROUP BY business.stars 
ORDER BY business.stars DESC

		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1: Total Reviews
Close: 4
Open: 504
          
ii. Difference 2: Review Useful Count 
Close: 1
Open: 13
         
SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT is_open as OPEN1_ClOSE0, ROUND(AVG(b.stars)) as AVGSTAR ,SUM(b.review_count) as REVIEW_RECEIVED, COUNT(r.useful) as REVIEWED_USEFUL
FROM business b INNER JOIN review r ON b.id = r.id
GROUP BY b.is_open

+--------------+---------+-----------------+-----------------+
| OPEN1_ClOSE0 | AVGSTAR | REVIEW_RECEIVED | REVIEWED_USEFUL |
+--------------+---------+-----------------+-----------------+
|            0 |     2.0 |               4 |               1 |
|            1 |     3.0 |             504 |              13 |
+--------------+---------+-----------------+-----------------+
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
Finding the effect of review_count and check-in on the life of a business. 
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
Two (2) tables were needed to get the answer for the above analysis. I used the INNER JOIN to avoid getting the ‘None’ value.

The below selected data will prove that even that a company received only 1 star it is still open for business. That businesses that received highest checkin count not necessarily have 5 stars and so on. Thus, this data means that there is no direct correlation on stars, review_count and checkin. 

It would be good for YELP to indicate the current population for the neighbourhood on that business.                  
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
